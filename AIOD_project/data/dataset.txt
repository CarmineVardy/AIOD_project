The dataset consists of plasma metabolomics profiles acquired by LC–MS from pregnant women
whose pregnancy outcome was known at birth. For each woman, one blood sample (plasma) was
collected and analysed in both positive (ESI+) and negative (ESI–) ionisation modes.

Total samples (pregnancies): 178

Outcome classes:
    Healthy children: 100
    Pathological cases with congenital heart disease (CHD): 78

For each ionisation mode, the raw LC–MS data were processed to obtain a feature matrix in which:

    -Columns correspond to individual plasma samples (178 pregnant women).

    -Rows correspond to LC–MS features (referred to as metabolites).

    -Entries are the measured signal intensities (peak areas) for each feature in each sample.

Thus, the dataset is composed of two high-dimensional blocks (ESI+ and ESI–), each providing a complementary
view of the maternal plasma metabolome, with a binary outcome label (CTRL vs CHD) attached to every sample.

The overarching aim is to identify metabolic alterations in maternal plasma associated with foetal CHD and to
evaluate whether LC–MS–based metabolomic profiles can discriminate pregnancies leading to healthy vs
CHD-affected children.
