Project pipeline
Pre-processing
    QC removal
    Anomaly detection
        Standard deviation and z-score
        Benchmarking Anomaly Detection Algorithms
        Loadings removal
            ⚠ Due to a limited loadings availability, choose carefully if removing samples could be the best choice
    Normalization
        Total ion count
        PQN (Probabilistic Quotient Normalization)
        Quantile normalization
    Dataset merging
        Dataset merging -> Normalization / Normalization -> dataset merging
        guardare il cambiamento della media, mediana e dei fattori correttivi tra una scelta e l'altra
        Se effettuare il merging, usare i QC
    ⚠ Chemical adjustment
    Math adjustment with log transform
    Graphs generation
        PCA score
        Biplot
        Loadings
        Internal variability
    Centering
    Cleaning Nan samples
        Already done in the original datasets
    Random dataset shuffle
    Dataset splitting in training and test sets
        Leave One Out
        Choose splitting ratio between 70-30% or 80-20%
        Analyze and choose the most tailored splitting technique with respect to the sample indipendence
        Biological replicates (In this case from same mother) -> same set
        Normalization
        PCA
        Internal variability
        Compare these analysis with the same ones generated on the dataset and determine if the splitting technique is the most suitable one
